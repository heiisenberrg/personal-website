                        I'm a developer with a passion for crafting pixel perfect user interface. My expertise lies in building responsive applications. 
                        With over <strong>6 years</strong> of hands-on experience, I specialize in creating pixel-perfect interfaces using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>React Native</strong>.
                       
                        <br></br>My journey has taken me through diverse technology landscapes â€“from lead the development of e-learning applications at Kaplan Inc. to the fast-paced world of mobile gaming at Mobile Premier League and to building innovative travel platforms at Traform Technologies. Each role has added new dimensions to my expertise in frontend and mobile development.
